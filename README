This is a study guide intended to be used in the course Optimising Compilers of
Lunds Universitet. The course's main website is:
http://cs.lth.se/eda230
I'm a student taking the course.

The guide will cover some of the material from the book, as suggested in the reading
advice. A star next to the range means 'done', an arrow means 'in progress'.

You can also download the not-so-often-updated PDF file from the Downloads page
of the project.
